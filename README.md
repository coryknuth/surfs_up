# Analysis of June and December in Hawaii

We were tasked with analyzing and comparing temperature data from summer and winter in Hawaii to determine if the weather would support year round business for a prospective surf shop. We were given data going back several years of consistent temperature measurements taken in the month of June and the month of Decemeber. This gave us a olsid sample to compare average temperatures for these months, as well as other summary stats like high and low.

## Results

First, here is a comparison of the summary data for the two months.

June

December

1. **The average tempurature is only 3 degrees colder in December compared to June**
  
  *Over the time span of the 6 years of data we were given, both December and June demonstrated remarkably stable temperatures.   With an average temp for June of 74.9 degrees, and an average temp in December of 71.0 degrees, we see strong consistency of prime surfing weather through the entire year. *

2. **The standard deviation for both months is nearly equal**

  *This further supports from the data that the temp variation for both June and December is generally mild, consistently providing very favorable surfing temperatures.*

3. **December can dip below 60 degrees, which is cold for many surfers**

  *We did see a relatively low minimum temp that can occur in December. While the average temps support that these sub-60 degree events are infrequent, if not rare,   it does represent weather which would decrease surf activity for it duration. This would certainly be felt by the business in the way of customer traffic, however, given the data,   and the consistency of the averages, these possible low temperatures will be infrequent enough to avoid any severe impact to the business.  
  
  ## Conclusion
  
  Overall, we are actually very bullish on the idea of opening a surf shop in this location. Based on our available temperature data, the temperature around the future business location is consistenly warm, over the course of the entire year. You may see an occasionaly spell through the winter months where surfing declines as only the bravest, sporting the warmest wetsuits will brave the water in 50 degree temps, but these times will be infrequent. Our recommendation for further analysis that we should perform would be to explore the wind data for the area in summer and winter, to ensure there is consistenly adequate waves to support surfing. As well as examining precipitation data to see how frequently it rains.

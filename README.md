# Analysis of June and December in Hawaii

we were tasked with analyzing and comparing temperature data from summer and winter in Hawaii to determine if the weather would support year round business for a prospective surf shop. We were given data going back several years of consistent temperature measurements taken in the month of June and the month of Decemeber. This gave us a olsid sample to compare average temperatures for these months, as well as other summary stats like high and low.

## Results

First, here is a comparison of the summary data for the two months.

1. **The average tempurature is only 3 degrees colder in December compared to June**
  
  Over the time span of the 6 years of data we were given, both December and June demonstrated remarkably stable temperatures.   With an average temp for June of 74.9 degrees, and     an average temp in December of 71.0 degrees, we see strong consistency of prime surfing weather through the entire year. 

2. **The standard deviation for both months is nearly equal**
3. **December can dip below 60 degrees, which is cold for many surfers**
